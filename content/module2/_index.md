# Module 2

### You are a Gourmet Inc developer and need to test the latest version of your code.

In this module, you are going to deploy a sandbox based on the Promotion Manager blueprint directly from Torque's blueprint catalog. When you launch the sandbox, Torque will automatically install and configure the application for you using the most cost-effective infrastructure. You will be able to access your application's UI directly from Torque and also access your application's cloud infrastructure for troubleshooting purposes. And when the sandbox's duration ends, Torque will automatically terminate your deployment and delete its cloud resources, so no need to worry about ghost VMs or infrastructure sprawl!
