In this step, you will edit a blueprint provided in your Git repository and modify it to meet the needs of your developers. Instead of three VMs, the promotion manager application components will all be deployed on one VM.

1\. Edit __promotion-manager-all-aws-dev.yaml__. You can find this file in the Git directory of your repo:
aws-workshop-colony/blueprints/

**NOTE**: This blueprint assumes you have permissions to deploy in the "eu-west-1" region with your AWS account; if not, update the value in the __clouds__ section accordingly.
